# Directory Explorer Web Application

## Project Description:
The project aims to develop a directory explorer using JavaScript, React.js, Node.js (Express.js), and CSS (SCSS). The primary goal of the project is to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to navigate through a directory structure. The application will display the parent directory, and users will have the ability to view the child directories within it. The project will leverage the power of React.js to create an interactive and dynamic user interface, while Node.js and Express.js will handle the server-side functionality. CSS and SCSS will be used to style the application and ensure a visually appealing experience for the users.
The directory explorer will provide various features to enhance the user's ability to manage the directory structure. Users will have the option to add new folders, rename existing folders, and delete folders within the child directories. These actions will be performed through intuitive and user-friendly interactions, making it easy for users to organize and manipulate their directory content.
Overall, this project aims to create an efficient and effective directory explorer using JavaScript, React.js, Node.js (Express.js), and CSS (SCSS). By combining these technologies, the application will provide users with a seamless and intuitive experience for navigating, managing, and organizing their directory structure.
