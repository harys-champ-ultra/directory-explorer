# Directory Explorer Web Application

## Project Description:
- This project involves the development of a directory explorer using a combination of JavaScript, React.js, Node.js (Express.js), and CSS (SCSS).
- The primary functionality of the directory explorer is to display the contents of a parent directory, denoted as "C".
- Users will have the ability to view the child directories within the parent directory "C".
- The user interface will allow users to perform actions such as adding a new folder, renaming existing folders, and deleting folders within the child directories.
- The project will utilize JavaScript as the main programming language, React.js for building the user interface components, Node.js (Express.js) for server-side functionality, and CSS (SCSS) for styling and layout purposes.
- The directory explorer will provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with the directory structure.
- Emphasis will be placed on ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience, with efficient loading and rendering of directory contents.
- The project will adhere to best coding practices, following modular and scalable architectural patterns, and leveraging the capabilities of the selected technologies.

## Project Outcomes:
- A fully functional directory explorer application will be developed, capable of displaying and navigating through the contents of a parent directory.
- Users will be able to view the child directories within the parent directory and access their contents.
- The application will provide an intuitive user interface that allows users to add new folders, rename existing folders, and delete folders within the child directories.
- The directory explorer will be built using JavaScript, React.js, Node.js (Express.js), and CSS (SCSS), showcasing proficiency in these technologies.
- The project will demonstrate efficient handling of directory data, ensuring smooth performance even with large directory structures.
- The application will be responsive and accessible, adapting to different screen sizes and meeting modern web standards.
- Best coding practices and modular architecture will be employed, promoting code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.
- The project will highlight the developer's ability to create a professional-grade application, meeting the requirements and expectations of a directory explorer.
