# Directory Explorer Web Application

# Description
This project is a directory explorer web application built using React and Express. The primary goal of this application is to provide users with an intuitive interface to navigate through directory structures, create new folders, rename existing folders, and delete folders within a selected parent directory.

* Key Features:
  * Parent Directory View: Users can view the contents of the parent directory "C" including all its folders. The application provides an organized and user-friendly display of the directory structure.
  * Child Directory Navigation: Users can explore the child directories within the parent directory "C". By clicking on a specific folder, the application dynamically updates the view to display the contents of the selected directory.
  * Folder Creation: Users have the ability to create new folders within the child directories. Through an interactive interface, users can specify the name of the new folder and create it with a single click.
  * Folder Renaming:
Users can easily rename any existing child directory. By selecting a folder and choosing the rename option, the application allows users to enter a new name for the selected folder, instantly updating it.
  * Folder Deletion:
Users can delete any unwanted child directory. By selecting a folder and choosing the delete option, the application prompts for confirmation before permanently removing the selected folder and its contents.

Overall, this directory explorer web application offers a convenient and efficient means for users to interact with directory structures. By leveraging the power of React and Express, the application provides an intuitive interface and seamless functionality, empowering users to effortlessly manage their directories and folders.

* Technologies:
  * React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React enables the creation of reusable components and facilitates efficient rendering and state management.
  * Express: A minimalistic and flexible Node.js web application framework. Express is used for building the backend server that handles API requests, communicates with the file system, and serves the React frontend.
